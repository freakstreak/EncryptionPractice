In this project I have tried to build an app just like Secret Whisper website but my main focus was on securing user login by various encryption methods and integrating google login with manual login. 

This project is built under Express.js and Node.js and here i have used MongoDB and mongoose as my backend and have used google- strategy for my google authentication. 

Here i have used passport.js and express-session for encryption of user password and integration of cookies to our app.
